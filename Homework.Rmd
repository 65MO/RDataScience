title: "Homework"

## Description
There will be five homework assignments throughout the semester to ensure that you are learning the materials.  

## Homework logistics
The homeworks will be posted on this website and submitted to UBLearns.  I will provide a .R text file that looks something like this:

```
#' ## Question 1
#' Load the iris dataset by running
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
data(iris)

#' And read about the dataset in the documentation:
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
?iris

#' 
#' > How many observations (rows) are there for the versicolor species?
#' 
#' _______________________
#' 
#' ## Question 2
#' Create a vector with the following values:  23, 45, 12, 89, 1, 13, 28, 18. 
"' Then multiply each element of the vector by 15.  
#' 
#' > What is the standard deviation of the new vector? 
#' 
```

You will then write code to answer the questions and submit the answers into a quiz on UBLearns.  You will also upload your modified .R file so I can see the code you used to answer the question.
