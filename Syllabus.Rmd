# Logistics
Professor Adam M. Wilson (adamw@buffalo.edu)

Office Hours: Mondays 2-3pm

## Schedule 
Mondays 5:00-7:40pm in 144 Wilkeson Quad.  

## Course Structure	
The course will focus on programming in the R language. Typical class sessions will consist of a short (~30 minute) lecture followed by around two hours of interactive exercises.   All teaching and exercises are done from within Rstudio using RMarkdown  code structure. 

## UBLearns
Course announcements, readings, and other materials will be distributed through [UBLearns](https://ublearns.buffalo.edu).  Please check the site regularly (or enable email notifications).  

## Computer requirements
The course will include class exercises on student laptops (under any operating system) or computer lab machines (if needed).  Students will need to install RStudio on their laptops (instructions here).  

## Email Policy
During the week, I will attempt to respond to emails within 24 hours of receiving them (not including weekends).  Do not expect an immediate response (please plan accordingly).  For example, do not send an email with a question about a homework the same day that the homework is due.   If you send an email over the weekend, do not expect any response until Monday or Tuesday.

# Student Learning Outcomes
Successful completion of this course will enable the student to use the R programming language to: 

1. develop approaches for integration of information/data
2. inspect data and apply basic statistics to analysis and communication of geographical topics
3. Understand and use scientific methodologies to perform spatial analyses in reproducible research workflows.  

These learning outcomes can be related to those expected of students completing the Geography program. 


# Course Requirements
## Grading

### Course Participation (10%)
You are expected to actively participate in class discussions and follow along during in-class interactive exercises.  If you are not able to attend class, please let me know as soon as possible so an alternative can be arranged.

### Homeworks (30%)
Homework assignments will be assigned throughout the semester and due before class the following week.  The lowest two grades will be dropped.  Assignments will be provided via UBLearns as R scripts with embedded questions. It will look something like this:

```
#' ## Question 1
#' Load the iris dataset by running
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
data(iris)

#' And read about the dataset in the documentation:
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
?iris

#' 
#' > How many observations (rows) are there for the versicolor species?
#' 
#' _______________________
#' 
#' ## Question 2
#' Create a vector with the following values:  23, 45, 12, 89, 1, 13, 28, 18. 
"' Then multiply each element of the vector by 15.  
#' 
#' > What is the standard deviation of the new vector? 
#' 
```


You can open the R script in RStudio and write the code needed to answer each question.    Your work will be uploaded to UBLearns with multiple choice or numeric answers for each question.  Your your R/RMarkdown script will also be uploaded as the response to the final ‘question’.  Your script will not be graded, but will be taken into account if there are any questions about the assignment or grading.  UBLearns will prevent  submission of homework after class starts, so be sure to get it in on time.  

You are welcome to work collaboratively on homework assignments but you are responsible for developing your own code to answer the questions.  So an acceptable question to ask a classmate would be, “which functions did you use to answer number 4?,” while an unacceptable question would be “please email me your code for question #4.”    
Some homework assignments will have  a bonus question that builds upon material covered in class but is more complicated than the homework questions.  These will be worth additional point(s).   

### Final Project (60%)
The final project will consist of a dynamically generated report of a spatial analysis related to each student’s interest.  Report will be uploaded to UBlearns as a PDF file with RMarkdown source code.  This project can be related to the student’s own research or a separate topic.  The report (minimum 12 page, maximum 30 pages) should include standard sections for a research manuscript: 

1.	Title
2.	Abstract
3.	Introduction with description of the question/problem
4.	Methods description
5.	Data description
6.	Interpretation and discussion of results (including figures)
7.	References

## Timeline & Grading:

* 10/5  Project proposal (<1 page, 10 points)
* 11/16  First draft due (10 points)
* 12/14: Final Project due (10-20 pages, 40 points).  Unexcused late submissions will be docked 10 percentage points per 24 hour period.  

*There will be no final exam.*

## Grading Scale
Course grading will follow the grading procedures of the UB Graduate School (http://grad.buffalo.edu/Academics/Policies-Procedures/Grading-Procedures.html).


| Quality of Work       | Weighted Percentage | Quality Points  | Weighted Grade| 
| ---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Superb                | 92+%                | 4               | A             | 
| Excellent             | 90+%                | 3.67            | A–            |

| Good                  | 85+%                | 3.0             | B             |
| Acceptable            | 80+%                | 2.67            | B–            |

| Barely Adequate       | 70+%                | 2.0             | C             |
| Substantially Flawed  | 60+%                | 1.0             | D             |

## Textbook
There will be no textbook for the course.  All materials will be available through this website.

## Academic Integrity 
The course will follow the university Academic Integrity Policy.   Please review it and ask if you have any questions.  Writing computer code often involves use of existing code chunks (e.g. copying an example from the documentation) which complicates identification of academic dishonesty. Students are responsible for comprehending the code they submit, regardless of its source.  If there is reason to believe that submitted code was simply copied from elsewhere, the student will be asked to verbally (and specifically) explain the code used in the analysis to ensure comprehension.
