## Spatial Data Science with R
GEO 503

## Adam M. Wilson
<div class="columns-2">
Assistant Professor of Global Environmental Change<br>
Geography Department



I Use R:

* GIS (with a little GRASS)
* Statistics
* Graphs
* HTML/Websites (including this one!)

</div>

## Today's plan

1. Course website (UBLearns) and syllabus
2. What is R?
3. Who uses it?
4. Reproducible Research
5. Guided interactive coding

## Course Structure

Mondays 5-7:40 (2 hours 40 min)

* Review/Questions
* 30 Minute Presentation
* Semi-guided interactive exercises on your laptops

## 3 Learning Objectives

1. Become familiar with R programming language
2. Learn to code geospatial analyses in R
3. Learn to develop reproducible research workflows

## This course is NOT
A statistics course (see GEO 505, etc.). 
We will focus on workflow and methods (‘how’ not ‘why’)

## Why program?

Add ArcGIS screenshot

Graphical User Interfaces are useful,

<blockquote>
A man who does not know foreign language is ignorant of his own.
<br> -- Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749 - 1832)
</blockquote>

Learning a programming language can help you learn how to think logically.

<blockquote>
The computer is incredibly fast, accurate, and stupid. Man is unbelievably slow, inaccurate, and brilliant. The marriage of the two is a force beyond calculation. <br> -- Leo Cherne
</blockquote>

Programming gives you access to more computer power.

## R Project for Statistical Computing

* Free and Open source
* Data manipulation
* Data analysis tools
* Great graphics
* Programming language
* 6,000+ free, community-contributed packages
* A supportive and increasing user community

R is a dialect of the S language  developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T) by John Chambers et. al. (same group developed C and UNIX©)

## What is the R environment?

* effective data handling and storage facility
* suite of operators for (vectorized) calculations
* large, coherent, integrated collection of tools for data analysis
* graphical capabilities (screen or hardcopy)
* well-developed, simple, and effective programming language which includes:
     * conditionals
     * loops
     * user defined functions
    * input and output facilities

## Reproducible, Portable, & Transparent

## R Graphics

## Spatial data in R
Packages: sp, maptools, rgeos, raster, ggmap 
Examples:
 species range overlays

## Parallel Processing
For BIG jobs:
multi-core processors / high performance computing with foreach.

## Strengths & Limitations

* Just-in-time compilation
     * Slower than compiled languages <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
     * Faster to compose <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> 
* Many available packages <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>
* Most operations conducted in RAM
     * RAM can be limiting and/or expensive <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
     * `Error: cannot allocate vector of size X Mb`
     * Various packages and clever programming can overcome this… <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>
* Free like beer **AND** speech! <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up" aria-hidden="true"></i>

## Reproducible Research

* The ability to reproduce results from an experiment or analysis conducted by another*
* Developed from literate programming:
* Logic of the analysis is represented in output 
* Combines computer code with narrative


## Reproducible Research
Typical GUI Workflow
Organized and repeatable workflow (and some example commands)

## Following Along
RStudio

# Assessment / Grading

* **Course Participation (10%)** Actively participation
* **Package Presentation (10%)** Overview of a R package of your choice
* **Homeworks (30%)** 
* **Final Project (50%)** a dynamically generated set of figures (like an infographic) of a spatial analysis related to each student’s interest.  Report will be uploaded to UBlearns as a PDF file with RMarkdown source code.  This project can be related to the student’s own research or a separate topic.

## Homework
Working collaboratively is encouraged but you are responsible for developing your own code to answer the questions. 

* **Acceptable:** “which functions did you use to answer #4?” 
* **Unacceptable:**  “please email me your code for #4.”

## Homework format

```
#' ## Question 1
#' Load the iris dataset by running
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
data(iris)
#' And read about the dataset in the documentation:
## ------------------------------------------------------------------------
?iris
#' > How many observations (rows) are there for the versicolor species?
#' _______________________
#' ## Question 2
#' Create a vector with the following values:  23, 45, 12, 89, 1, 13, 28, 18. 
"' Then multiply each element of the vector by 15.  
#' > What is the standard deviation of the new vector? 
```
